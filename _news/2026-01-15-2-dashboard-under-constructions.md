The dashboard page will soon provide real-time status updates for our lab's infrastructure and educational systems.

### GPU Infrastructure Health Check & Monitoring
SNSec Lab manages high-performance computing resources to support data-driven security research. The dashboard will visualize the utilization of our four key systems, equipped with:
*   NVIDIA RTX 5090
*   NVIDIA RTX 5090
*   NVIDIA RTX 4090
*   NVIDIA RTX A6000 Ada Generation

### PythonJudgeSystem Status
For the *Introduction to Computer Programming* lectures (Spring 2026), we will operate **PythonJudgeSystem**, a live grading platform for student submissions. The system is available at [https://github.com/seonghoony/2026-PythonJudgeSystem-ICP](https://github.com/seonghoony/2026-PythonJudgeSystem-ICP).

The dashboard will display live metrics including:
*   Last fetch time
*   List of anonymized students and their submission status
*   Overall correct rate
*   CDF over time showing student submission progress
