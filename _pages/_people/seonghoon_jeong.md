### Seonghoon Jeong
From September 2024, I work at Division of Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University (SMWU), Seoul, Republic of Korea, as an assistant professor.

#### Research goal

I investigate and address cybersecurity challenges in Internet service applications through a data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning and deep learning methodologies. I have experience in analyzing a wide range of valuable datasets obtained from real-world services, including massive online game, root DNS servers, mobile payment transaction data, and car hacking activities.

Recently, my focus has been on in-vehicle anomaly and intrusion detection---a research area that demands urgent attention, given the severe consequences of compromised vehicle systems. Specifically, I have developed a standardized intrusion prevention system for connected vehicles that offers practical solutions to both industry professionals and academic researchers.

Now I'm dealing with an intrusion detection system that automatically interprets conducted attacks on automotive Ethernet.
